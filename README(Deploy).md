**Covey Town with hubs**


Modify the hub abstraction such that each hub has a map layout (interior view of a Hub). The user can navigate the Covey.Town and can check the various hubs. They can enter the hub by navigating through the main door. Hubs can act as dedicated meeting rooms. As a user enters a hub, the layout will change to the interior of the hub and the user will be able to see all the other users(avatars) present in the hub.
