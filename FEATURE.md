# Features

The 3 main features of our project are:

1. User tries to go to public Hub

3. User Isolation from Covey.Town

## 1. User tries to go to public Hub (School and Hospital are public hubs)

### 1-A. Feature

A Covey.Town user can navigate Covey.town and can see various hubs. The goal of this feature is to navigate through a public Hub entrance so that the user can enter, view, and navigate the interior of the Hub and interact with other users(avatars) in the Hub. The user can enter the Hub by navigating to the main door. They will press the space bar on the keyboard and will enter, the map layout will change to the interior of the Hub. They will also be able to see all other avatars that are inside the Hub. They can navigate the Hub map using the arrow keys. To exit, they can exit by navigating to the main door and pressing the space bar.
