The user can enter the Hub by navigating to the main door. They will press the space bar on the keyboard and will enter, the map layout will change to the interior of the Hub. They will also be able to see all other avatars that are inside the Hub. They can navigate the Hub map using the arrow keys. To exit, they can exit by navigating to the main door and pressing the space bar.
